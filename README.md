# NFL_Rushing
In the National Football League (NFL), roughly a third of teams’ offensive yardage comes from run plays.. Ball carriers are generally assigned the most credit for these plays, but their teammates (by way of blocking), coach (by way of play call), and the opposing defense also play a critical role. Traditional metrics such as ‘yards per carry’ or ‘total rushing yards’ can be flawed; in this competition, the NFL aims to provide better context into what contributes to a successful run play.
